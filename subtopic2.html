      <td>Abstract:</td>
      <td>In this article, Chapin Hall’s Center for State Child Welfare Data supports state child advocacy agencies in building as well as using administrative data systems to better child welfare decision making. The center uses an agency’s digital intake, case, and result records to create databases for continuous quality improvement, performance measurement, policy analysis, and more. A core objective of the center’s mission involves data linking techniques to merge records and information from different programs, while simultaneously ensuring elevated data quality and security. It also provides technical assistance and training for child welfare professionals on using and interpreting stored case-level data. Their resources illustrate how management data can be stored safely.</td>
