      <td>Abstract:</td>
      <td>In this article, Sylvia’s Child Advocacy Center explains the important role of forensic interviews in child abuse investigations and highlights the use of digital recording and video technology tools during these interviews. The website emphasizes that interviews with children are recorded using cameras and microphones, allowing other professionals, such as law enforcement and child protective services, to observe the interaction without the child being interviewed and questioned repeatedly. The digital recording tools are crucial as they preserve the accuracy of the child’s disclosure, capture nonverbal cues, and more. Digital recording and video technology minimizes the number of times a child has to recount their experience, as well as reduce trauma and provide support to all in an effective investigative process.</td>

      <td>In this article, Cardinal Peak Technologies describes the CaseCracker Onyx system which is a digital interview recording tool suited for child advocacy centers. The system allows professionals to start the recording process by simply pressing a button, reducing the need for a complicated start-up process. Additionally, the system allows for the recording to be efficiently and quickly saved, even if it is a large file. Onyx also includes in-interview note-taking and metadata tagging, allowing the interviewer to focus on the interview they are conducting rather than identifying key moments necessary for later paperwork. The system has high-definition pan, tilt, and zoom cameras that are able to follow the interviewee throughout the process, as well as, high-definition digital microphones that are able to capture all sounds. This technology helps ensure reliable documentation of forensic interviews, decreasing the need for repeated questioning and the potential of revictimization.</td>
